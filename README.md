# Sunshine UF

This is a website used to list versions of Sunshine UF:s websites and business plans. The purpose of this project is to store the source code of sentimental reasons.

> [!NOTE]
> Sunshine UF was our UF company me and some classmates created during the UF course in high school (Tranemo Gymnasieskola). We sourced and sold portable device chargers powered by sunlight. During the project's life span of two semesters we've had multiple versions of the websites and the final one even won price during the local UF fair (Ung Företagsamhet Älvsborg) for best website.
