# Sunshine UF

This website archives versions of Sunshine UF’s websites and business plans. The purpose of the project is to preserve the source code for sentimental reasons.

## Background
Sunshine UF was a company founded by me and a group of classmates as part of the UF (Young Enterprise) program at Tranemo Gymnasieskola. We sourced and sold portable solar-powered device chargers. Over the course of the two-semester project, we created several versions of our website. The final version even won an award for Best Website at the local UF fair (Ung Företagsamhet Älvsborg).

## Web development
This project was my first project reagarding web development. I made this during a course in Web Development and learned along the way. This is what laid the ground for me and pushed me in the direction of becoming a front-end developer. Most of the code was written directly in *TextEdit* before I later moved on to *Adobe Dreamweaver*.
